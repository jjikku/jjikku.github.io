                    <span id="dots14">...</span><span id="more14">Kerala's history is ancient, has centuries-old foreign trade links and a long tradition in art and literature. With a very high literacy rate, Kerala is at the forefront in setting high standards in social justice, gender equality, health and education in the country.

                        An epitome of religious harmony, it was through Kerala that Christianity and Islam made its entry to India. And not just that! The country's first church and mosque are located in Kodungallur in central Kerala.
                        
                        Kerala is the spice garden of the world. Earlier, traders from far flung lands reached Kerala in search of the spices. Later, European powers followed this spice route to reach Kerala.
                        
                        Enriched by Nature and abundance of water, Kerala can be reckoned as the land of rains. Its lifelines are the two rainy seasons of Idavappaathi and Thulavarsham.
                        
                        Let us set out on a voyage through the history and culture of this land that is inimitable. A journey replete with vibrant colours, flavours and music …. It will unravel to us the mysteries of Kerala.</span></p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">The staple food of Kerala is greatly influenced by the history and culture of the state. It’s a blend of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, in which the latter is prepared a variety of items like fish, poultry and red meat. Rice, fish, and coconut are the most common ingredients of almost all Kerala famous food. 
                    <span id="dots15">...</span><span id="more15">Though the traditional food of Kerala, including Kerala Sadya prepared during festivals and celebratory ceremonies, is vegetarian, the contemporary food of the state includes non-vegetarian dishes. One might also be able to identify the taste of coconut in most dishes in Kerala, owing to the fact that blending grated coconut and its milk in food for thickening and flavouring is a common culinary practice in India.

                        So, for all those who think Kerala food is all about idlis and dosas, you’re in for a surprise! Our Kerala food items list and Kerala food photos will definitely grab your attention.
